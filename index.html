            <h2>3D Model Project</h2>
            <p>I frequently use 3D modeling as a tool for rapid prototyping, creating small components to help develop projects and test various designs. I also do 3D modeling as a personal hobby, creating characters and environments to be used in online social platforms that feature user-generated content. </p>
            <p>The character shown here was created by me from scratch over a couple weeks. The model was sculpted in ZBrush, finalized and rigged in Blender, and textured using Substance Painter. It was then exported and set up in Unity for real-time VR applications.</p>

        <summary>CSS</summary>
        <p>For my unique CSS element, I used the transition property to make it so that when you hover over the images, it transitions into an increased size & different rotation, rather than instantly being set to it. You can choose the transition time and smoothing function - I chose a 0.3 second transition using the ease-in-out function.</p>
        <p>I also used the image filter property, so that the images become darker with more contrast when hovered over.</p>

        <summary>HTML</summary>
        For my unique HTML element, I used these detail boxes! They're very simple to set up and use, and good for stuff like this - things that aren't critical to the site's purpose (being a portfolio), but that I still have to include regardless to meet requirements. Because the summary is in its own HTML tag, I can add CSS to bold the summaries, making them stand out more.

        Using MouseEvents, the "Expand All" button at the top expands all detail elements, and changes to "Close ALl" if they are all open.
