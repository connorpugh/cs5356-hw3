            <h2>3D Model Project</h2>
            <p>I frequently use 3D modeling as a tool for rapid prototyping, creating small components to help develop projects and test various designs. I also do 3D modeling as a personal hobby, creating characters and environments to be used in online social platforms that feature user-generated content. </p>
            <p>The character shown here was created by me from scratch over a couple weeks. The model was sculpted in ZBrush, finalized and rigged in Blender, and textured using Substance Painter. It was then exported and set up in Unity for real-time VR applications.</p>
