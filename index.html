            <h2>3D Model Project</h2>
            <p>I frequently use 3D modeling as a tool for rapid prototyping, creating small components to help develop projects and test various designs. I also do 3D modeling as a personal hobby, creating characters and environments to be used in online social platforms that feature user-generated content. </p>
            <p>The character shown here was created by me from scratch over a couple weeks. The model was sculpted in ZBrush, finalized and rigged in Blender, and textured using Substance Painter. It was then exported and set up in Unity for real-time VR applications.</p>

    <h2>About This Website</h2>
    <p>For my unique CSS element, I used the transition property to make it so that when you hover over the images, it transitions into an increased size & different rotation, rather than instantly being set to it. There are multiple settings for transition time, and smoothing function - I chose a 0.3 second transition using the ease-in-out function.</p>
    <p>I also used the image filter property, so that the images become darker with more contrast when hovered over.</p>
